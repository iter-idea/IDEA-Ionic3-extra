# IDEA Ionic extra
IDEA's extra components and services built on Ionic.

## Includes

- Loading service
- Message service
- Checker component
- Calendar component (w/ datetime component)

## Requirements

Each component may **require** one or more folders of the `assets` directory, 
including `icons`, `libs` and `configs`; see more in a random recent IDEA's project.

## How to use

**To use** by importing the released package in the components folder of the desired project.  
Since it's (it should be) a read-only folder, you can safely copy/paste **updated versions**.

*In the future* it can be thought as an npm package, so far it doesn't look doingable.

## How to release

Take the latest version of the `idea` folder, zip it and upload it on GitHub.
