# IDEA Ionic extra
IDEA's extra components and services built on Ionic.

**To use** by importing the released package in the components folder of the desired project.  
Since it's (it should be) a read-only folder, you can safely copy/paste **updated versions**.

*In the future* it can be thought as an npm package, so far it doesn't look doingable.
